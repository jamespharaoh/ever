Simple command line client for evernote.

I wrote this so I could do some batch renames. It can be extended to do more,
and probably will be when I need to do something else.

You need an evernote client key to use it.

Usage:

$ ./ever auth username password key_id key_secret
Authenticating as username

$ ./ever list-notebooks
Listing notebooks
23319254-3f67-4937-851d-d425c06e148a usernames's notebook

$ ./ever list-notes-by-notebook 23319254-3f67-4937-851d-d425c06e148a
Listing notes
389712b1-eb7c-4e87-8dd7-0c2db92a3b1b a sample note

$ ./ever rename-note 389712b1-eb7c-4e87-8dd7-0c2db92a3b1b new name
Renaming note

$ ./ever end
Session ended

It stores authentication details in ~/.config/ever, and deletes them when you
run the "end" command.
